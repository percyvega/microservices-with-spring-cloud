Spring Cloud Summary


bootstrap.yml (where the config server points to a Git repo) is loaded before application.yml.
This helps when there are properties required for configuring the application.


@EnableConfigServer
  This application is where other applications obtain their properties.
  Its application.yml contains spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri pointing to a Git repo path.
  Dependency: spring-cloud-config-server

Config Client
  This application will obtain its properties from a config server.
  Its bootstrap.yml contains
    spring.application.name
    spring.cloud.config.uri
    spring.profiles.active
  Dependency: spring-cloud-starter-config


@EnableEurekaServer
  This where all the Eureka client URLs are stored for later discovery by other clients.
  Dependency: spring-cloud-starter-eureka-server

@EnableEurekaClient
  This application registers itself (via its name) with its defaultZone (a Eureka Server).
  Its bootstrap.yml contains
    spring.application.name
    spring.cloud.config.uri
  Dependency: spring-cloud-starter-eureka

Eureka user
  Not necessarily an @EnableEurekaClient. This application just uses the Server to find the Clients.
  Its bootstrap.yml contains
    spring.application.name
    spring.cloud.config.uri
    spring.profiles.active
  Dependency: spring-cloud-starter-eureka


Ribbon
  Client-side load balancer (allows a client to select a regional server based on some criteria)


Feign
  Allows you to write calls to REST services (alternative to RestTemplate) using only interfaces.
